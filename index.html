    <h1 id = "about-title">What the heck are Salmon Cookies?</h2>
    <br>
      <p>Founder and renowned Seattle entrepreneuer Pat Cookie has come up with the next big thing....cookies made with ground up fish! But don't worry, they taste like normal cookies and the fish powder makes them healthier than normal cookies. They're also made to resemble the popular Northwest fish so they're perfect for impressing those out-of-towners who are looking for a taste of Seattle. Boy will they get a mouthful. We have multiple locations all over the city, with new spots popping up all the time so be sure to check back regularly.
